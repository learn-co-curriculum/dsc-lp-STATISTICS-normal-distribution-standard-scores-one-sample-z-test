#### Lesson Summary:

This lesson begins by asking students to describe the parameters that characterize a normal distribution and to discuss the empirical rule. Students use numpy, matplotlib and seaborn to create histograms of normal distributions. From there, the standardized normal distribution is discussed and students are asked to standardize normally distributed data. After discussing the standard normal distribution, students should discuss why the standard score is a useful statistic. Using a real world dataset, students compute z-scores from values and convert z-scores to values. The remainder of the lesson is spent discussing statistical testing with z-scores. Students are presented with conceptual questions relating to statistical testing with z-scores and p-values. Then, students are asked to compute the probability of observing values given some z-scores. Then they perform two-sided and one-sided z-tests for data provided to them (at significance level alpha = 0.05), after stating null and alternative hypotheses.

* Students can create and visualize normal distributions using python packages. 
* Students can interpret the standard score of an observation from normally distributed data.
* Students know how to standardize normal distributions. 
* Students can define the significance threshold $\alpha$ and its relation to p-value. 
* Students can define null and alternative hypotheses, and when they're used. 
* Students can use scipy methods to compute the p value of a z-score and are able to interpet the significance of results. 
* Students understand and can perform 1-sample z-tests.
